# DumiLang

Dumilang is a language, in part a sibling to the graphical design editor for creating Dumicola applications, but also the application runtime that executes them. That is, the graphical designer compiles designs into the same bytecode that the Dumilang engine uses to execute scripts.

### Types

There are five built in types to Dumilang, although others may be defined by component libraries.

Type | Width | Class | Description
---- | ----- | ----- | -----------
bool | 1 | Primitive | Boolean
int | 32 | Primitive | Long signed integer
deci | 32 | Primitive | Floating point
string | N | Primitive | Ascii string
List | N*W | Primitive | An array (Mixed typing)
Map | N*W | Primitive | A map of types [APPSID, (Mixed typing)]

### Components
~~Components are the fundemental constructions exported by Dumilang. Each Dumilang file defines a single component.~~
